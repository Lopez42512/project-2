        <p class="paragraph-1"> My name is Ismael Lopez and I'm a Full Stack developer in Training.
        I've attended Community College of Philadelphia off and on for the last seven years. I returned after two years last fall where I discovered my love for coding.
        The python class I took taught me that coding was the career I was looking for all this time. 
        With this new passion I did some research and found the Penn Coding Boot Camp, where I will learn the skills necessary to become a Web Developer and pursue me passion of coding.
